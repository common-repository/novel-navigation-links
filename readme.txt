Adds associated navigation links to bottom and top of content if there is a page or post with similar slug.

== Description ==

If you are on page "example.com/2016/09/22/my-novel-chapter-23" and there is also a page with slug "my-novel-chapter-22" then previous chapter link would be added. If there is page "my-novel-chapter-24" next chapter link would be added too.

Pages and posts wouldnt be associated to each other even if they have similar slugs. Pages would be associated with pages and posts with posts.
Works with both pages and posts, permalink structre doesnt mather as long as your slug ends with hyphen followed by chapter number.

Example:

*   example.com/2016/09/22/my-novel-chapter-23
*   example.com/my-novel-chapter-23
*   example.com/my-novel-index/my-novel-23
